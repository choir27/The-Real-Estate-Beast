## How It's Made: Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
I built the foundations of the HTML code using semantically correct code, Flexbox was my primary method for building a responsive and efficient layout for the entire website, where I used distinct classes to organize the process of applying different layout designs.  I organized the CSS code into the respective sections of the website and steadily worked on progressing through the HTML and CSS until they were completed.  Using function statements, if/else logic, and DOM manipulation, I built a simple yet effective way to carousel through the video thumbnails on the home page.  I left the media query for last to prevent any changes in the main design or the code to prevent breaking the overall layout of the website.

## Lessons Learned:
In order to make the form subject function the way that it currently does, I needed to go research and find the javascript code that would help.  After finding the code that I was looking for, I was able to discover a new method of using both the DOM and JS code while using syntax that I was already familiar with.  This reinforced the lesson that there is always something new that can be accomplished with code and there is always more to learn about it.
